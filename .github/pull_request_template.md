## 🧘🏻 Reviewer's mindset
```text
Reviewers perform the following roles with a “light” mindset:
- Find typos
- Ask questions
- Ask about things you don’t know, such as variable names and business logic.
- The person asked the question can repeat it while explaining it, and the purpose of the questioner is to gain knowledge about logic by looking at the answer.
- Make suggestions
- Is this purpose A? A If the purpose is right, why not try it like this? To this extent, write your own hypothesis and proposal together.
- Make sure readers can check the information at once, if possible.
