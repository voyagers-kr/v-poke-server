### "If you are a Pokemon lover, always keep it by your terminal"

V-pokemon is designed for developers who love Pokemon.

You can see the Pokémon of each generation in ASCII format in the terminal. We made this for those of you who want to see Pokemon, but are concerned about the company around you.

You can learn about the strengths, weaknesses, and history of a Pokémon by looking at the Pokémon Encyclopedia, and you can also take a quiz to guess which Pokémon it is just by looking at its silhouette.
